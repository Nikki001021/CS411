Idea 1：An app that helps high school students keep track of college applications and requirements as well as calculate the probability of them getting in based on the students’ statistics (including GPA, awards, financial affordability, etc.) and previous statistics of the college.
Idea 2: An app that first asks for the clients’ monthly budget, job location, and salary. Then based on the priority list set by the client (go with budget/convince/etc.), create a housing plan for the client (based on the average housing price of the district, the nearby grocery/malls, the nearby transportation, the distance to his/her job, etc.).
